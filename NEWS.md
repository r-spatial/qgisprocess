# qgisprocess 0.1.0

- Initial CRAN submission.
- While the package has been incubating for a few years as a development version, quite a few namespace changes were made in 2023 before preparing the first CRAN release (#153).
Since the package probably had a substantial user community before these changes, old function names still work but these are deprecated.
They will be dropped at a later stage.
